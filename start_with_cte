-- A Common Table Expression (CTE) in SQL is a temporary, named result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
-- CTEs are particularly useful for simplifying complex queries, making them easier to read and maintain.

WITH cte_name (optional_column_list) AS (
    -- CTE query definition
    SELECT ...
    FROM ...
    WHERE ...
)
-- Main query
SELECT ...
FROM cte_name;

WITH HighEarningEmployees AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Salary > 50000
)
SELECT *
FROM HighEarningEmployees;

"""
In this example:

The WITH clause defines the CTE named HighEarningEmployees.
The CTE query selects employees with a salary greater than $50,000.
The main query then selects all columns from the HighEarningEmployees CTE.
CTEs can be very powerful for breaking down complex queries into more manageable parts. They can also be used recursively to solve problems that involve hierarchical data12.
